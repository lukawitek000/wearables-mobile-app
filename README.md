Part of the Wearables project includes the Lilygo TTGO T-Watch (http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50053&Id=1290&FId=t3:50053:3), which is responsible for recording gestures, identify them (https://github.com/laszkiewiczp/gesture-recognition) and send to the mobile app via Bluetooth Low Energy.

Application for Android 8.0+ devices to record statistics sent from the smartwatches.
